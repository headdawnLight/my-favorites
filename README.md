# my-favorites

This is a front-end web development project. This project was developed with the React.js library. Used Bootstrap CSS library for responsive web and mobile design. With this project, CRUD operations can be performed. Web browsers are used as database with LocalStorage.

## Introduction

What are your top three favorites about anything? Use this app and create a card with your top three favourites. You can decorate this card with a title and a picture. Create a new card or list your cards. Sometimes update, sometimes delete. If you don't clear your browser data, your browser will always keep the cards in its memory.
